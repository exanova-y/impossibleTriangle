A graph that can explores balancing three things in a student's life: Sleep, studying and extracurriular. The code combines geometry with behavioural research and the graph is coded without using any libraries for the sake of practicing technique. This project is collected into the best grade 12 OOP design projects of all time, out of hundreds of projects.
